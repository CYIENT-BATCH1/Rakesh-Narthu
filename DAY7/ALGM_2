2. Write a code to swap even bits with odd bits in unsigned long variable(uint64).
 
Algoritham
 1.Declare unsigned int with x and l.
 2.Enter and scan the values.
 3.Define unsigned even and x and with 64 bit A value.
 4.Define unsigned odd and  x and with 64 bit 5 value.
 5.Make even rightshift with 1 and odd leftshift with 1 and make OR operator to each values and store in l.
 6.Then print l value.
