3. Write program to clear(0) bits CIS, CM2, CM1, CM0 in register “CMCON” if bits CHS3, CHS2, CHS1, CHS0 bits are set to 0x07 in register “ADCON0”

Algorithm:

1.intialize the two input
2.convert the hexa value into binary format and give that value to ADCON
3.iterate the ADCON register and we get the decimal value of 28
4.By using this we can clear the bits of ADCON  register
5.print the o/p
